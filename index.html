        <p class="lead">Dear Friends,</p>
        <p class="lead">Thank you for joining us in celebrating George’s 85th birthday and honoring a life’s work in pursuit of a more free and open society.</p>
        <p class="lead">Among the most important causes George has championed is Central European University, the global graduate university he founded in 1991. Next year, CEU will celebrate an exciting milestone of its own – its 25th Anniversary.</p>
        <p class="lead">To mark these two very special occasions, we have joined with CEU to establish the George Soros Leadership Fund, both in honor of George and in recognition of the extraordinary impact the University has made around the world in its first quarter century.</p>
        <p class="lead">Now in more than 120 countries, CEU’s 12,000 alumni are working to transform closed societies and promote respect for human rights and human dignity. The Fund will build on CEU’s rich tradition of developing new leaders committed to advancing the values of democracy.</p>
        <p class="lead">In lieu of birthday gifts, I invite you to join in honoring George’s 85th and CEU’s 25th with a contribution to the George Soros Leadership Fund at this remarkable institution.</p>
        <p class="lead">Yours,<br />Tamiko Soros</p>
